## Hi cXML Contributors 👋

This organization is the brainchild of Markus Thielen (https://github.com/mathielen) and Giovanni Piemontese (https://github.com/ynnoig) in cooperation with the company Emil Löffelhardt GmbH & Co.KG. (https://github.com/Loeffelhardt) to offer different implementations of the cXML standard (https://cxml.org) in different programming languages.

If you have a desire to contribute and/or implement the cXML standard in a language not yet present, we welcome your request.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
